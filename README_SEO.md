SEO & Google Search Console â€” Quick Steps

1) Replace placeholder URLs
 - The repo has been updated to use your Vercel URL `https://imon-sir-website.vercel.app/`.
 - Verify that the site is deployed at that URL; if you prefer another canonical domain (www vs non-www), update `index.html` canonical accordingly.
- The repo has been updated to use your Vercel URL `https://imon-sir-website.vercel.app/`.
- Verify that the site is deployed at that URL; if you prefer another canonical domain (www vs non-www) or a custom domain, update `index.html` canonical accordingly.

2) Google site verification (HTML tag method)
- Add a new property for your domain (prefer "Domain" property) or URL-prefix (e.g., https://imon-sir-website.vercel.app).
If you choose URL-prefix, use the "HTML tag" verification method and paste the meta tag already present in `index.html`:
  <meta name="google-site-verification" content="21WnAsJHeuDGbkDgcbsONx4JkrVbA6qMkFn-HbTx8qI" />
- Save and deploy your site (so the meta tag is live at the root URL), then click "Verify" in Search Console.

3) Submit sitemap
- Ensure `public/sitemap.xml` is deployed at `https://your-domain/sitemap.xml`.
- In Search Console, go to the property > Sitemaps > enter `/sitemap.xml` and Submit.

4) Test and monitor
- Use the URL Inspection tool in Search Console to test your homepage and important pages.
- Use Google Rich Results Test or the Structured Data Testing Tool to validate JSON-LD.
- Monitor Coverage and Performance reports; fix issues and resubmit pages when updated.

Notes & Tips
- Canonical link in `index.html` should point to your preferred URL (www vs non-www, http vs https).
- Replace the Open Graph image with a 1200x630 px image for best results.
- Allow Google some time (hours to days) to crawl and index after verification and sitemap submission.

If you want, I can also:
- Generate a larger sitemap automatically from your routes.
- Add per-page meta tags dynamically if you introduce SSR or an SSG step.
